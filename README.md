## Third Party Libraries
We used react

### Features Available
There are 2 users: admin and user.

We had to cut the admin panel as that was all Haifeng's work and he didn't communicate exactly how to finish it or what its purpose was.
We also cut continue as guest as there was not enough time to finish that feature.
The register and edit profile pages don't have much functionality as most of that would be handled in the backend. 
There is no email verification or email invitations sent out as that would be handled by backend.
The organizer of the event counts as the admin.
We got rid of the taskbar on the top of the event page as there wasn't enough time to complete it and it wasn't deemed completely necessary.
The live chat currently just displays preset messages but will not show new messages as that will be handled by the backend.
